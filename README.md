# MathematicsForImageComputing

This code shows completed assignments for my Mathematics for Image Computing class in the Spring of 2022.

Some initial code provided by the professor can be found in the provided folder, which are implementations of algorithms discussed in class. All code for assignments was created by me, and also generally result in implementations of relevant algorithms.

Topics covered in this course include border detection algorithms, image compression and various bases, Fourier transforms, convolution and Gaussians, and more.
